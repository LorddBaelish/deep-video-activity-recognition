# video-activity-recognition
This is an ongoing project for my undergraduate final year project. 
##Goals 
  *Use trained 3D convolution model to extract video features
  *Classify videos using learned parameters for convolving filters and training Dense layer 
<return> Final system is able to classify an incoming live stream in real-time to recognize human actions in a shopping mall. Stream only contains a single human at a time and robust to possible variations in the scenario. System is based on 3D convolution layers and reference link is included below. <return>
